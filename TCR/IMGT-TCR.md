2. What is the organization of the human TRA,TRB,TRG and TRD loci? 
   - TRA  
   Q: What is the organization of the human TRA locus?  
   A:  The [human TRA locus on chromosome 14](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/index.php?section=LocusGenes&repertoire=locus&species=human&group=TRA) at 14q11.2 spans 1000 kb. It consists of 116 genes: 54 TRAV, 61 TRAJ and a unique TRAC gene. The TRD locus is nestled in the TRA locus between the TRAV and TRAJ genes. Among the 54 variable genes are included 5 genes designated as TRAV/DV which belong to 5 different subgroups and which have been found rearranged either to TRAJ or to TRDD genes and can therefore be used in the synthesis of alpha or delta chains.  
   - TRB  
   Q: What is the organization of the human TRB locus?  
   A: The [human TRB locus on chromosome 7](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/index.php?section=LocusGenes&repertoire=locus&species=human&group=TRB) at 7q34 spans 620 kb. It consists of 82-85 genes: 64-67 TRBV, 2 TRBD, 14 TRBJ and 2 TRBC genes. Except for TRBV30, localized downstream of the TRBC2 gene, in inverted orientation of transcription, all the other TRBV genes are localized upstream of a duplicated D-J-C-cluster, which comprises, for the first part 1 TRBD, 6 TRBJ and the TRBC1 gene, and for the second part, 1 TRBD, 8 TRBJ and the TRBC2 gene. In contrast to the other TRBV genes, TRBV30 rearranges by an inversion mechanism.    
   - TRG  
   Q：What is the organization of the human TRG locus?  
   A: The [human TRG locus on chromosome 7](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/index.php?section=LocusGenes&repertoire=locus&species=human&group=TRG) at 7p14 spans 160 kb. It consist of 19-22 genes: 12-15 TRGV belonging to 6 subgroups, upstream of a duplicated J-C-cluster, which comprises, for the first part, 3 TRGJ (TRGJP1, TRGJP and TRGJ1) and the TRGC1 gene, and for the second part, 2 TRGJ (TRGJP2 and TRGJ2) and the TRGC2 gene.  
   Two haplotypes with 12 or 14 TRGV genes correspond to allelic polymorphisms by insertion/deletion of the V4 and V5 genes. A rare haplotype with 15 TRGV genes has been detected by Southern analysis.   
   - TRD  
   Q: What is the organization of the human TRD locus?  
   A: The [human TRD locus on chromosome 14](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/index.php?section=LocusGenes&repertoire=locus&species=human&group=TRA) at 14q11.2 comprises a cluster of 10 genes: 1 TRDV, 3 TRDD and 4 TRDJ, the unique TRDC gene, and 3' of TRDC, 1 TRDV in inverted orientation. The cluster spans 60kb and is localized between the TRAV and TRAJ genes. 1 TRDV gene is localized at 360 kb of TRDC, among the TRAV genes. 5 genes described as TRAV/DV have been found rearranged to either TRDD or to TRAJ, and can therefore be used for the synthesis of delta and alpha chains.

4. How to make 10^14 TcR-Alpha,10^8 TcR-Beta,10^4 TcR-Gamma and 10^8 TcR-Delta chains?(2.10^12 different T cell receptors)  
   - TRA  
   Q: How to make 104 different T cell receptor alpha chains?  
   A: [From the TRA genes to the T cell receptor alpha chains](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTeducation/QuestionsAnswers/_UK/PosterTRA/switchTRA.html)  
   The TRA ***V-J rearrangements*** in the T cells create a [combinatorial diversity](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTeducation/QuestionsAnswers/_UK/PosterTRA/switchTRA.html) of 2200-2300 recombinations. One important additional mechanism contributes to the T cell receptor alpha diversity: the **N diversity** (N, for nucleotides) which results from deletion and/or addition of nucleotides **at random** by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and creates, at the V-J JUNCTION, a region **not encoded** in the germline DNA. In contrast to the immunoglobulin loci, there is no mechanism of somatic mutations in the T cell receptor loci. The TRD locus is nestled in the TRA locus. V-J rearrangements in the TRA locus therefore result in deletion of the TRD genes localized on the same chromosome.   
   - TRB  
   Q: How to make 108 different T cell receptor beta chains?  
   A: [From the TRB genes to the T cell receptor beta chains?](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTeducation/QuestionsAnswers/_UK/PosterTRB/switchTRB.html)  
   The TRB ***V-D-J rearrangements (D-J then V to D-J rearrangements)*** in the T cells create a [combinatorial diversity](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTeducation/QuestionsAnswers/_UK/PosterTRB/switchTRB.html) of 960-1248 recombinations. One important additional mechanism contributes to the T cell receptor beta diversity: the **N diversity** (N, for nucleotides) which results from deletion and/or addition of nucleotides **at random** by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and creates, at the V-D-J JUNCTION, two regions **not encoded** in the germline DNA. In contrast to the immunoglobulin loci, there is no mechanism of somatic mutations in the T cell receptor loci.  
   - TRG  
   Q: How to make 104 different T cell receptor gamma chains?  
   A: [From the TRG genes to the T cell receptor gamma chains](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTeducation/QuestionsAnswers/_UK/PosterTRG/switchTRG.html)  
   The TRG ***V-J rearrangements*** in the T cells create a [combinatorial diversity](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTeducation/QuestionsAnswers/_UK/PosterTRG/switchTRG.html) of 20-30 recombinations. However, most of the gamma-delta T cells from the peripheral blood express predominantly a gamma-delta T cell receptors with V9-JP-C1 gamma chain. One important mechanism contributes to the T cell receptor chain diversity: the **N diversity** (N, for nucleotides) which results from deletion and/or addition of nucleotides **at random** by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and creates, at the V-J-JUNCTION, region **not encoded** in the germline DNA. In contrast to the immunoglobulin loci, there is no mechanism of somatic mutations in the T cell receptor loci.   
   - TRD  
   Q: How to make 108 different T cell receptor delta chains?  
   A: [From the TRD genes to the T cell receptor delta chains](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTeducation/QuestionsAnswers/_UK/PosterTRD/switchTRD.html)  
   The TRD V-D-J rearrangements ***(D-J rearrangement then V to D-J rearrangements)*** in the T cells create a [combinatorial diversity](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTeducation/QuestionsAnswers/_UK/PosterTRD/switchTRD.html) of 36-2 24 recombinations. Two or even the 3 TRDD may be used in a V-D-J rearrangements leading to 192 or 224 potentiel recombinations, respectively. One important additional mechanism contributes to the T cell receptor chain diversity: the N diversity (N, for nucleotides) which results from deletion and/or addition of nucleotides **at random** by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and creates, at the V-D-J-JUNCTION, regions **not encoded** in the germline DNA. There are up to four N diversity regions in V-D-J-JUNCTIONs comprising 3 TRDD. In contrast to the immunoglobulin loci, there is no mechanism of somatic mutations in the T cell receptor loci.
