### 47. EMDomics
[EMDomics: Earth Mover's Distance for Differential Analysis of Genomics Data](https://rdrr.io/bioc/EMDomics/),The EMDomics algorithm is used to perform a supervised multi-class analysis to measure the magnitude and statistical significance of observed continuous genomics data between groups. Usually the data will be gene expression values from array-based or sequence-based experiments, but data from other types of experiments can also be analyzed (e.g. copy number variation). Traditional methods like Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) use significance tests based on summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the distributions. This approach lacks power to identify expression differences between groups that show high levels of intra-group heterogeneity. The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) algorithm instead computes the "work" needed to transform one distribution into another, thus providing a metric of the overall difference in shape between two distributions. Permutation of sample labels is used to generate q-values for the observed EMD scores. This package also incorporates the Komolgorov-Smirnov (K-S) test and the Cramer von Mises test (CVM), which are both common distribution comparison tests.

### 49. KnowSeq 
[KnowSeq](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/KnowSeq.html),KnowSeq proposes a whole pipeline that comprises the most relevant steps in the RNA-seq gene expression analysis, with the main goal of extracting biological knowledge from raw data (Differential Expressed Genes, Gene Ontology enrichment, pathway visualization and related diseases). In this sense, KnowSeq allows aligning raw data from the original fastq or sra files, by using the most renowned aligners such as tophat2, hisat2, salmon and kallisto. Nowadays, there is no package that only from the information of the samples to align -included in a text file-, automatically performs the download and alignment of all of the samples. Furthermore, the package includes functions to: calculate the gene expression values; remove batch effect; calculate the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs); plot different graphs; and perform the DEGs enrichment with the GO information, pathways visualization and related diseases information retrieval. Moreover, KnowSeq is the only package that allows applying both a machine learning and DEGs enrichment processes just after the DEGs extraction. This idea emerged with the aim of proposing a complete tool to the research community containing all the necessary steps to carry out complete studies in a simple and fast way.
