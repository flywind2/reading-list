## **1. methsurv**
[methsurv](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/methsurv/),A web tool to perform multivariable survival analysis using DNA methylation data.  

## **2. UALCAN**
[ualcan](http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/),UALCAN is a comprehensive, user-friendly, and interactive web resource for analyzing cancer OMICS data. It is built on PERL-CGI with high quality graphics using javascript and CSS. UALCAN is designed to, a) provide easy access to publicly available cancer OMICS data (TCGA and MET500), b) allow users to identify biomarkers or to perform in silico validation of potential genes of interest, c) provide graphs and plots depicting gene expression and patient survival information based on gene expression, d) evaluate gene expression in molecular subtypes of breast and prostate cancer, e) evaluate epigenetic regulation of gene expression by promoter methylation and correlate with gene expression, f) perform pan-cancer gene expression analysis, and g) Provide additional information about the selected genes/targets by linking to HPRD, GeneCards, Pubmed, TargetScan, The human protein atlas, DRUGBANK, Open Targets and the GTEx. These resources allow researchers to gather valuable information and data about the genes/targets of interest.  

## **3. MeT-DB**  
[MeT-DB](http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/methylation/), a database of transcriptome methylation in mammalian cells.  

## **4. DiseaseMeth**  
[DiseaseMeth](http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/diseasemeth/), the human disease methylation database.  

## **5. MethPrimer**  
[MethPrimer](http://www.urogene.org/methprimer2/index.html),is an online platform which provides a number of tools and databases to facilitate the study of DNA methylation and epigenetics, including tools for designing primers and probes for various bisulfite conversion based PCRs, predicting CpG islands, and manipulating sequences.  

## **6.Primer Design and Search Tool**  
[BiSearch](http://bisearch.enzim.hu/), is a primer-design algorithm for DNA sequences. It may be used for both bisulfite converted as well as for original not modified sequences. You can search various genomes with the designed primers to avoid non-specific PCR products by our fast ePCR method. This is especially recommended when primers are designed to amplify the highly redundant bisulfite treated sequences.  

## **7. MEXPRESS**  
[MEXPRESS][https://mexpress.be/], visualize DNA methylation,expression and clinical data
